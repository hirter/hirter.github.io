In the comments above both lines the values that should be filled in between braces are described. If you registered a node as ABP on the TTN Dashboard, you have to uncomment the initABP line, and copy the correct keys from the dashboard into the Arduino sketch. Note that this is a hexadecimal value, so only numbers (0-9) and the capital letters A-F are valid. The strings should not contain any other characters. Use the example keys in the sketch as guideline what it should look like.

Program the code onto your Arduino. If it runs, the LED on the Arduino should be constantly on, except for going out for 100ms once every 5s. This means it is transmitting packets to TTN. If you do not see this behaviour, check your wiring.
